A SHORT NOTE:

Hey Team,

About me: 
I am Omkar, from Odisha. I have been freelancing on Upwork since my Class 9 making WordPress, Webflow and Framer sites. I am also comfortable with almost any SaaS tool out there, be it Figma or Fillout, I adapt to new tools according to Situation.

My Skillset:
— WordPress
— Webflow
— Framer
— Literally everything else that I need to learn, I'll learn it, fast and with excellence

Why me?
I am learning Kotlin & CPP currently. I know professional communication, teamwork and most importantly how to tackle and solve a problem in the most efficient way. 

I may not good coded projects right now, but I promise to be the most hardworking & knowledgeable member of the club in a few months.

And, I am fun!

Thank you!
Omkar
