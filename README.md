## About Me  
Hi Team,  

I’m **Omkar** from Odisha. I’ve been freelancing on Upwork since Class 9, creating websites using **WordPress**, **Webflow**, and **Framer**. I’m adept at mastering new SaaS tools as needed, whether it’s **Figma**, **Fillout**, or anything else that the situation demands.

## My Skillset  
- **WordPress**  
- **Webflow**  
- **Framer**  
- And anything else—I’m a fast learner and adapt quickly.

## Why Me?  
Currently, I’m learning **Kotlin** and **C++**. I bring:  
- Professional communication skills  
- A collaborative attitude  
- The ability to efficiently solve problems  

While I’m still building my coding expertise, I’m committed to becoming one of the most hardworking and knowledgeable members of any team within a short time.  

Oh, and I’m fun to work with!  

Thank you,  
**Omkar**
